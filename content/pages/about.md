## Journey Till Now

Shubham has been existing on this planet since 2001. He celebrates his birthday on the 14th of October. He was brought up in a typical Indian, nuclear conservative family. His mother tells that he used to be quite chubby â™¥but a big cry-baby ðŸ˜’ in his childhood. He spent his early childhood days playing cricket in scorchy summers, playing computer games ðŸ˜Ž and watching cartoons on television.

In 2011, he moved to the historic city of Aurangabad with his family. He joined Ryan International School, as a fifth grader in Aurangabad. He spent time dancing in the morning assemblies, playing Dragon-City & Farmville ðŸ¤© and playing cricket. Shifting back to Mumbai, he joined Meridian School in 2014. Here, some of the best friends with whom he had some best memories of his life ðŸ¥°. Here, he tried out many things like participating olympiads ðŸ¤”, making projects for science exhibitions and also tried to learn salsa ðŸ˜Ž. Towards the end of his schooling life, he came to know about this exam IIT-JEE which all smart-confused-science-lovers-school-topper kids give. That was it, he made up his mind to write this exam two years later. He then spent the two most gruelling, most challenging, most depressing years of his life. Spending most of his time on his study table, travelling for hours in the jam-packed local trains of Mumbai and struggling to cover up the massive JEE syllabus taught him some of the best lessons of his lifeðŸ˜£. In 2019, he wrote the JEE advanced and cleared it âœŒ. Soon, he entered IIT Kanpur as an excited, confused, under-confident freshman.

He left home and was on his own for the first time in his life. At IITK he met some awesome people ðŸ˜², made crazy friends ðŸ¥³ (ending up doing crazy things) and learnt many life lessons. Then some idiot ate an bat and the entire world went crazy. He went back home to stay safe with his parents. He studied over the internet for the next one and half years. And here we are!

## Interest and Hobbies

**Robotics:-** I love Robotics. It was my childhood dream to make hi-tech stuff. I lead the software subsystem of team AUV-IITK. I have worked on many different aspects of Autonomous Vehicles like autonomous navigation, controls and vision. I have learnt a lot of new things and I currently researching in the field of autonomous robotic navigation and Simulataneous Localization And Mapping. I am working on building our third generation bot Tarang, and so that our team can participate in Robosub 2022 in USA next year.

**Debating:-** I am very passionate about debating. I have liked public speaking since school days. I am the coordinator of the Debate and Discussion Society, IITK. I taken part in multiple National and International Debating tournaments as an adjudicator as well as a speaker. My goal to break at Major Debating tournament this year (hopefully Australs 2021).

**Web Development:-** I had explored Web Development during the first two years at university. I had mostly explored the frontend frameworks (React & Angular) of Web Development and had rudimentary understanding of backend frameworks (Express) and no-sql databases (MongoDB). I had spent a significant time contributing to open source organization Oppia, learning a lot of things in the process. Although I do not actively learn Web Development now, I like working on it. 

Besides these, I also try (and fail with varying levels of disappointment) at Competitive Programming. I like to find solutions to problems using algorithms. I am also pursing a minor Algorithms due to my interest in this field. 

I loved playing computer games (right since my childhood). I used to be really crazy Call of Duty gamer. I also used to spend a lot of time playing FIFA. However, I don't game much nowadays because of busy schedules. In addition to that, I have now permanently migrated to Linux. I despise Windows and Microsoft. 

I love staying fit and muscle building. I try to workout daily. Although I am not particularly good at any sport, I love playing all sort of sports like Cricket (Pace Bowling), Football (Goal Keeping) and many others.

I sometimes also watch TV Series. I try to avoid them because I feel they are too time-consuming. However I have watched the cliche sitcoms like Friends, Big Bang Theory and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

I love listening to music. My favourite bands are One-Direction and Linkin Park. I really love Spotify's songs recommendations. Most of my favourites are those that feature in the top 50 globally.
