Hi meet Shubham, just another human being amongst the 7.9 Billon people calling this planet Earth their home. He is from India, a third world Asian country. He is typical Maharashtrian boy, born and brought up in Mumbai's Suburbs. When people have a generic names like "Shubham" and cool/different lastnames like "Korde", people mostly call them by their lastnames 😂. "Korde" is no exception to this. Sometimes people also call him "Shubham". Anyways, what's there in name??

## Journey Till Now

Shubham has been existing on this planet since 2001. He celebrated his 18th birthday last year on the 14th of October (for the first time away from his family) with his friends. He was brought up just like a typical Indian boy. His mother tells that he used to be quite chubby ♥but a big cry-baby 😒 in his childhood. He spent his early childhood days playing cricket in scorchy summers, playing computer games 😎 and watching cartoons on television.

In 2011, shortly after seeing India lift the World Cup 😍, he moved to the historic city of Aurangabad with his family. He joined Ryan International School, as a fifth grader in Aurangabad. He spent time dancing in the morning assemblies, playing Dragon-City & Farmville 🤩 and playing the Non-Mumbai style of cricket. In 2014, his shifted back to Mumbai with a "heavy-heart"(iykwim 😉).

He joined Meridian School in his 2014. Here, some of the best friends with whom he had some best memories of his life 🥰. Here, he tried out many things like participating olympiads 🤔, making projects for science exhibitions and also tried to learn salsa 😎 (peer pressure ofcourse). Towards the end of his schooling life, he came to know about this exam IIT-JEE which all smart-confused-science-lovers-school-topper kids give. That was it, he made up his mind to write this exam two years later.

Then began the two most gruelling, most challenging, most depressing two years of his life. Spending most of his time on his study table, travelling for hours in the jam-packed local trains of Mumbai and struggling to cover up the massive JEE syllabus taught him some of the best lessons of his life😣. In 2019, he wrote the JEE advanced and cleared it ✌. Soon, he entered IIT Kanpur as a confused, under-confident freshman.

For the first time in his life, he left home and was on his own. At IITK he met some awesome people 😲, made crazy friends 🥳 (ending up doing crazy things) and learnt a tonne of new things. The pandemic then caused a big vacation sending him back to his place. He then learnt Web Development, made this webpage and wrote up his journey till now.

## Interest and Hobbies

**Robotics:-** I love Robotics. It was my childhood dream to make hi-tech stuff. I am a part of the software subsystem of team AUV-IITK. Here, I mostly work on the Navigation of the bot. I have learnt a lot of new things in the field of Robotic Navigation and SLAM. Currently, I am exploring the field of Visual Odometry.

**Debating:-** I also love debating. I have liked public speaking since school days. I am currently an active member of Debate and Discussion Society, IITK. Here, I take part in various National and International Debating tournaments. I have mostly taken part in competitions as an Adjudicator. Having debated in most Asian Parliamentary Format, I am currently learning/training in the British Parliamentary Format.

**Web Development:-** I like to make websites. Websites with awesome UI make me really happy. I have been constantly learning new things in field of WebD. I have mostly explored the frontend frameworks(React) of Web Development although I have a basic understanding of backend framework (Express) and no-sql databases (MongoDB). I am currently working on my backend skills by learning in detail about NodeJS.

Besides these, I also try (and fail with varying levels of disappointment) at Competitive Programming.

I love playing computer games. I am really crazy about Call of Duty games. I have played all the COD games. I am also a mad FIFA gamer. Currently, I am playing Battlefield V.

I love staying fit and muscle building. I try to workout daily. Although I am not particularly good at any sport, I love playing all sort of sports like Cricket (Pace Bowling), Football (Goal Keeping) and many others.

I sometimes also watch TV Series. I try to avoid them because I feel they are too time-consuming. However I have watched the cliche sitcoms like Friends, Big Bang Theory and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

I love listening to music. My favourite bands are One-Direction and Linkin Park. I really love Spotify's songs recommendations. Most of my favourites are those that feature in the top 50 globally.
